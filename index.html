                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                great way to apply your skills to collaborative projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another interface, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and a myriad of other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of professionals collaborating across the world and internet, and
                this event specially welcomes anybody to that style
                of collaboration.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                collaborative skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
